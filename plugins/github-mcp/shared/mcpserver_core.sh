        # cost of one comparison, every non-integer whose fraction survives the
        # conversion to a double, leaving the literal test only what the double
        # rounded away.
        # Known gap, not an oversight: expanding an exponent rendering exactly
        # would mean decimal arithmetic in jq, so a rendering that keeps an
        # exponent falls back to the double-based verdict alone. jq renders an
        # exponent when the value is an exact multiple of ten — necessarily an
        # integer, so no gap there — or when its magnitude is below about
        # 1e-6, where `floor` still rejects a fraction unless the double
        # underflows to zero. What the gap admits is therefore a fractional
        # value smaller than the smallest subnormal double: `1.5e-400` is
