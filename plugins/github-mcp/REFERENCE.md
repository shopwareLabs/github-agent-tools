# Tools Reference

## Read Server (gh-tooling)

31 tools available via the `gh-tooling` MCP server. Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated.

### Shared Tool Parameters

All gh-tooling MCP tools accept these parameters:

| Parameter         | Type    | Default | Description                                                             |
|-------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `suppress_errors` | boolean | `false` | Silence stderr; errors produce empty output instead of an error message |
| `fallback`        | string  | --      | Return this text (successfully) when the gh command fails               |

Tools that produce structured JSON output also accept `jq_filter` (string) for filtering and transforming results with full jq expression syntax. A syntax check runs before execution to give early feedback on invalid expressions.

Tools with large text output (`run_logs`, `job_logs`, `pr_diff`) additionally accept:

| Parameter             | Type    | Description                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_lines`           | integer | Return only the first N lines (`head -n N`)                 |
| `tail_lines`          | integer | Return only the last N lines (`tail -n N`)                  |
| `grep_pattern`        | string  | Extended regex filter (grep -E); non-matching lines removed |
| `grep_context_before` | integer | Lines of context before each match (-B)                     |
| `grep_context_after`  | integer | Lines of context after each match (-A)                      |
| `grep_ignore_case`    | boolean | Case-insensitive matching (-i)                              |
| `grep_invert`         | boolean | Return non-matching lines (-v)                              |

`max_lines` and `tail_lines` are also available on `pr_view`, `pr_checks`, `pr_comments`, `pr_reviews`, `issue_view`, `api_read`, `label_list`, `project_list`, and `project_view` for output size control.

#### Repository selection

PR, issue, search, commit, and repo browsing tools accept the repository in any of these shapes — pass whichever matches the data you have:

| Shape                    | Example                                                | Notes                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `repo`                   | `repo: "shopware/shopware"`                            | Owner/repo string. Legacy short form.              |
| `repository`             | `repository: "shopware/shopware"`                      | Owner/repo string. Alias of `repo`.                |
| `owner` + `repo`         | `owner: "shopware"`, `repo: "shopware"`                | Split form. `repo` must be the bare name (no `/`). |
| `url` (repo tools only)  | `url: "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/..."` | Parsed for owner/repo/ref/path.                    |

If none of the above is supplied, the default repo from `.mcp-gh-tooling.json` is used. PR and issue tools also fall back to the local git remote when invoked inside a clone; outside a git repository they fail with a prescriptive error rather than letting `gh`'s native git-detection error surface.

Unknown parameters are rejected at the MCP layer (`additionalProperties: false`), so a misspelled or fabricated field returns an explicit error instead of being silently dropped.

```
Use gh-tooling issue_list with search "TODO label:component/core" and limit 20
```

### `issue_schema`

List an organization's issue types and issue fields, including each single-select field's options.
The organization comes from `org`, `owner`, a repository parameter, or the configured default repo.

Types and fields are independent. GitHub lets an organization pin fields to a type, but that pinning
only drives the web UI: any organization field can be set on an issue of any type, so this tool
reports the two lists side by side instead of nesting fields under types.

`type` and `field` match one name exactly, case-insensitively, and each narrows only its own list. A
name that matches nothing is an error rather than an empty list.

```
Use gh-tooling issue_schema with repo "shopware/shopware"
Use gh-tooling issue_schema with org "shopware" and type "Bug"
Use gh-tooling issue_schema with field "Priority" and jq_filter "[.fields[0].options[].name]"

### `release_list`

Look up release versions for one or more repositories. Built for dependency-update tasks: pass a `repos` array to get the latest version of each in a single call instead of one `api_read` per repo. Releases are sorted by semantic version descending (not by publish date), so the highest version is treated as latest.

```
Use gh-tooling release_list with repos ["actions/checkout", "actions/setup-node", "docker/build-push-action"] and fields ["repo", "tag_name"]
Use gh-tooling release_list with repo "docker/setup-buildx-action" and jq_filter ".[].tag_name"
Use gh-tooling release_list with repo "docker/build-push-action" and constraint "4" and latest false
Use gh-tooling release_list with repo "actions/setup-python" and resolve_sha true and fields ["tag_name", "commit_sha"]
Use gh-tooling release_list with repo "nodejs/node" and include_prereleases true and limit 50 and latest false
```

**Parameters:**
- `repos` (array of strings, optional): Batch mode -- repositories in `owner/repo` format. When set, the single-repo parameters are ignored and one entry is returned per repo.
- `repo` (string, optional): Single repository in `owner/repo` format. Also accepts `owner`+`repo`, `repository`, or `url`. Falls back to the configured default repo.
- `latest` (boolean, optional): Return only the highest-version release per repo. Default `true`. Set `false` for the full filtered list.
- `constraint` (string, optional): Restrict to a version line by prefix -- a major (`4`/`v4`) or major.minor (`4.2`/`v4.2`). Range operators (`^`, `~`, `>=`, `<`) are not supported. Filtering applies within the fetched window, so increase `limit` to reach older major lines.
- `include_prereleases` (boolean, optional): Consider prereleases. Default `false` (matches GitHub's `releases/latest` behavior).
- `include_drafts` (boolean, optional): Consider draft releases. Default `false`.
- `limit` (integer, optional): Releases fetched per repo before filtering. Default 30, capped at 100.
- `resolve_sha` (boolean, optional): Add a `commit_sha` field by resolving each tag to its commit (lightweight and annotated tags both resolve correctly). One extra API call per result. Useful for pinning GitHub Actions to an immutable SHA.
- `fields` (array of strings, optional): Restrict each result object to these keys. Allowed: `repo`, `tag_name`, `name`, `published_at`, `html_url`, `prerelease`, `draft`, `commit_sha`. Example: `["tag_name"]` for just version numbers.
- `jq_filter` (string, optional): jq expression applied to the final result array. Output is JSON; `.[].tag_name` reduces it to the (JSON-quoted) version strings.
- `suppress_errors` (boolean, optional): In batch mode, skip a repo whose lookup fails instead of failing the whole call.
- `fallback` (string, optional): Text to return if a lookup fails.

### `label_list`

List labels for a repository. Returns label names, descriptions, and colors.

```
Use gh-tooling label_list
Use gh-tooling label_list with repo "shopware/shopware"

- `jq_filter` (string, optional): jq expression to filter/transform the JSON output.
- `max_lines` (integer, optional): Return only the first N lines.

### `api_read`

Read-only GitHub REST API call (GET only). Use the gh-tooling-write server's `api` tool for POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE requests.

```

When `comments` is omitted, acts as a plain event-only review submission (uses `gh pr review`). When `comments` is provided, posts the full review via the REST reviews endpoint; `commit_id` is auto-fetched from the PR head if not given. Use ```suggestion blocks inside a comment body for one-click suggested changes.

```

```

**Parameters:**
- `number` (integer, required): Pull request number.

- `commit_id` (string, optional): Commit SHA the review is anchored to. Only used when `comments` is non-empty. Defaults to the PR's current head SHA (auto-fetched).
- `repo` (string, optional): Repository in `owner/repo` format.

#### `pr_comment`
